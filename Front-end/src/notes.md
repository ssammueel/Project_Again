1️⃣ Web Application Security Scanning 🔍

Tools to Integrate:

Nikto – Scans for outdated software, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.
OWASP ZAP – Analyzes web applications for SQL injection, XSS, and security weaknesses.
✅ Features to Add:

Custom Web Scanner – Allow users to input a URL and scan for vulnerabilities.
Automated Report Generation – Display found vulnerabilities with severity levels.

2️⃣ Exploitation & Post-Exploitation 💀
Once vulnerabilities are found, penetration testers need tools for exploiting and post-exploitation actions.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

Metasploit Framework – For running exploits and gaining access to target systems.
SearchSploit – Helps users find existing exploits for discovered vulnerabilities.
✅ Features to Add:

Exploit Search – Let users input CVEs or software names to find exploits.
Metasploit Integration – Provide common payloads (reverse shells, privilege escalation).
3️⃣ Password Cracking & Authentication Testing 🔑
Weak passwords remain one of the biggest security risks. Add tools to test authentication weaknesses.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

John the Ripper – Cracks password hashes.
Hydra – Tests login credentials against services (SSH, FTP, HTTP).
✅ Features to Add:

Brute Force Attack Module – Allow users to test weak passwords for specific services.
Custom Wordlist Upload – Let users upload their own password lists.
4️⃣ Wireless Network Security 📡
Wireless networks can be easy targets for attackers. Add support for WiFi security assessments.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

Aircrack-ng – Cracks WiFi passwords using captured packets.
Reaver – Exploits WPS vulnerabilities for WiFi cracking.
✅ Features to Add:

WiFi Network Scanner – Show nearby WiFi networks and security settings.
WPA Handshake Capture – Allow users to capture handshakes for cracking.
5️⃣ Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation 🎭
Security isn’t just about systems—it’s about people. Test how well users handle phishing attempts.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) – Automates phishing, credential harvesting, and email spoofing.
Gophish – Simulates phishing attacks for awareness training.
✅ Features to Add:

Email Phishing Simulator – Let users send test phishing emails.
Fake Login Page Generator – Simulate fake login pages to collect test credentials.
6️⃣ Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering 🦠
If the platform should include malware research, add tools for analyzing suspicious files.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

YARA – Scans for malware signatures.
Radare2 / Ghidra – Reverse-engineers binaries to analyze malicious behavior.
✅ Features to Add:

File Upload Analysis – Let users submit files for static & dynamic analysis.
Hash Lookup – Compare file hashes against virus databases.
7️⃣ Cloud & Container Security ☁️
With cloud services growing, cloud pentesting is crucial.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

ScoutSuite – Scans AWS, Azure, and GCP for misconfigurations.
Trivy – Scans Docker containers for vulnerabilities.
✅ Features to Add:

Cloud Misconfiguration Scanner – Scan AWS, Azure, or GCP for security flaws.
Container Vulnerability Scanning – Check Docker images for CVEs.
8️⃣ Red Teaming & Advanced Threat Emulation 🎯
For realistic attack simulations, add Red Team features.

✅ Tools to Integrate:

Cobalt Strike (if legal & licensed) – Simulates APT attacks.
Empire / Covenant – Post-exploitation and persistence frameworks.
✅ Features to Add:

Persistence Testing – Check how attackers maintain access after exploitation.
Lateral Movement Simulations – Test how an attacker can move within a network.
Final Touches 🚀
